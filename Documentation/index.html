    <h2>Read Me</h2>
    <p>
        Based on feedback from Project 1 and conversation with Craig, I tried to prioritize the user
        experience on this project. I started with looking at how people would access this project
        in my target sites i.e. South Asia mainly, and noted that most online experiences would be
        through mobile phones. Thus, my design was mobile first. <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Focus on one user experience</h3>
    <p>
        Though this project was conceputalized as a larger platfrom "Digital Futures Initiative"
        that will accomodate many kinds of content that is useful in the global south. I did not
        choose to start by building out the platform. Rather I took one small piece of that overall
        experience: a specifc lesson on image manipulation that will fall under the digital citizenship
        content and built that out. <br>
        <br>
        I found that process very useful because it actually began to reveal what would be needed from
        one users prespective, which I think enriched my understanding of the system. For e.g it was not
        clear to me initially if a chat/socket type solution would fit into this project. But as I built
        the user experience out, it has become clear that such a technical implementation would be
        useful each time a facilitator tries to run a session. <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Technical Resources</h3>
    <p>
        Technically the project uses Nodejs and Express to spin up a server and serve both
        html and js pages up dynamically. It also uses Pug as a templating engine. For the Nodejs
        and Express I largely found the resources shared in class to be sufficient with some use
        of stackoverflow/stackexchange to support problems. <br>
        <br>
        For Pug, I relied heavily on Pug documentation and also stackexchange. <br>
        <br>
        Technically the hardest part was to conceptualize the app. Since I have not really
        worked with webtech before I was not sure if doing it the way I did (putting all logic
        on the server) was appropriate or if more the logic should be pushed client side. <br>
        <br>
        To help understand this, I did about 3 "build your own app with MongoDB and Node" tutorials
        from youtube. These helped me see how others think about the project architecture. BUT it
        feels like the tutorial projects are way too simple to actually inform my choice. Because I was 
        feeling stuck, I decide to just pick a path. I picked the templating engine/server side route
        mostly because I had never done it before and it was a good way to learn.<br>
        <br>
        For the rest of this semester, I am committed to this architecture choice, but as I plan to
        expand this project into my final project. I plan to revisit it. I am curious if just sending a 
        JSON to the client, serving it up a js file and letting it do all the processing makes sense. Or if 
        such a choice would actually make it easier to work in low bandwidth environments.  <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Looking forward to I want to keep with this project. Also I want to keep with my focus on
        a limited user experience. Thus I think the next set of features I want to add are:
        <ul>
            <li>Modify my lesson plan into other languages/contexts. USER - Content Creator</li>
            <li>Create an instance of a lesson and invite end users to join it. USER - Facilitator</li>
            <li>Ask questions and have a realtime conversation in parallel with lesson. USER - End User</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
