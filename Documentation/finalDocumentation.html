    <h1> Final Documentation</h1>
    <h3> Technical Documentation</h3>
    <p> Technically in this project I implemented the project with Nodejs as the server side tool, a templating engine to
        serve up the client side files, a mongodb backend and vanilla js/html on the client side.
        Technically the biggest challenge was that I realized pretty late into the development that the way I had implemented
    the project i.e. with get requests that were processed resulting in the templating engine serving up new files, was not the best way.
I specifically found this out when I needed to send post requests because I was sending larger amounts of data than could be
accomodated in a URL. I dealt with this issue by doing POST requests followed by get redirects. I think this worked to test some of
basic ideas, but I feel it is an inelegant soltuion. I have outlined how I will attempt the next version in the reflection below.</p>
<p>Another significant technical challenge was understanding how the interpolation of the Pug templating engine worked.
    While the Pug documentation is pretty good, it does not clearly outline the right ways to handle interpolation in all cases. I am
    using interpolation in several ways. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>as a variable to be served up as HTML in the templating code</li>
    <li>as a variable that controls workflow (as conditions mostly) in the template</li>
    <li>as a variable within the script tagged javascript embedded inside the template</li>
    <li>as a varible embedded within html tags (for e.g. a dynamically generate variable for a onClick(x) inside an anchor tag</li>
</ul>
<p>All these different ways of using interpolation were confusing and I often found myself doing trial and error to sort out each way.
    <br> <br>
    Another interesting technical challenge was how to move image files back and forth between the client and server. I hacked my way through this
    by using a base64 encoding, but it appears there are many ways to do this, and I am not sure what the relative merit of each way is. Also one intersting 
    ideas that resulted from playing with the file transfer stuff was that I realized that one could store images as blobs in the DB. I may implement this in the next version.
    I think it is a lot less messy than putting files all over folders and tracking their names. 
</p>
<h3>Technical Next Steps</h3>
<p>I want to try doing the whole project again with a React front end, post requests, a node server and mongodb. I think this might work 
    better because this way the data can be send to the client just once... then the client side can handle a lot of the logic. I am wondering if this
    is a better solution for low-bandwidth environments. Also, it is probably faster. 
</p>

<h3>User Experience and Project Idea</h3>
<p>I am not completely satisfied with how users engage with my project. I think it's intent and use is still not clear
    without additional input and description by me. I had hoped that I could have a UX that mostly explains itself by the end of the class.
    However, I don't feel this project is there as yet. </p>

<p>
    In terms of the user experience I feel a few things have also gone well, and gotten built. For one, it's now easy to experience
    the lessons exactly as an end user would experience them. This helps a lot with people understanding how the tool is intented to be used. 
    Another thing that I feel is in good shape is the update mechanism for content designers. Based on user testing and feedback from my peers
    , this piece was changed to look exactly like the user piece.

</p>
<h3>User Experience Next Steps</h3>
<p>The next step on the user side is to focus on writing and videos that help users understanding how to use the tool.
    There are several aspects of the experience that need better documentation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>an about page that helps locate the project in the bigger picture</li>
    <li>videos that help the "power users" i.e. my new lesson designers understand my pedagogy and translate it</li>
    <li>videos but also a html lesson plan for the facilitators to take a single lesson and execute it</li>
</ul>
