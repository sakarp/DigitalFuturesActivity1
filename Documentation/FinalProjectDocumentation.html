        - mongo db, installed it and hosted it locally 
        - then struggled with schema because I had not organized into JSON
        - so I did that and then created a schema
        - learned how to use cmdline but felt more comfortable with compass
        -- link to JSON stuff
        - used JSON lint (https://jsonlint.com/) to ensure i wrote good JSON
